# pixtuoid-core/tests — agent guide

Integration tests for the headless lib, organized **by capability/layer** (the
suite's real axis), with the per-CLI dimension living where the actual variation
is — the source fixtures. 8 test binaries (each top-level `tests/*.rs` or
`tests/<area>/main.rs` is one binary):

```

## Governing principle

- **Code groups by capability/layer**, not by CLI. Only the subagent-lifecycle
  tests are single-CLI (`sources/{claude,codex}`); decode/conformance are cross-CLI.
- **Data scopes to the binary that reads it, sub-grouped by CLI.** A fixture read
  by one test module lives *with that module* at `sources/<module>/fixtures/`;
  fixtures the conformance harness iterates live in `sources/fixtures/<source>/`.

## Adding a new agent CLI — the test steps

1. **Always:** add `tests/sources/fixtures/<registered-source>/<scenario>/` — at
   minimum a `SessionStart` conformance scenario. `conformance.rs` auto-discovers
   it; `supported_sources_manifest` forces the manifest row; `cargo insta review`
   to accept the new snapshot. The dir name MUST equal the `REGISTERED_SOURCES`
   name (`claude-code`, not `claude`).
2. **Only if the CLI has unique behavior** (subagent hooks, custom lifecycle): add
   `tests/sources/<cli>.rs` (or `<cli>/mod.rs` if it needs private fixtures) and
   register `mod <cli>;` in `tests/sources/main.rs`. Plain CLIs (antigravity,
   reasonix) need none — `decode.rs` + `conformance.rs` cover them.

## Known sharp edges

- **Two tests stay FLAT and MUST NOT be moved into a grouped binary**:
  `socket_path_parity.rs` (`#[path]`-includes the hook shim's `paths.rs`) and
  `supported_sources_manifest.rs` (reads `../../site/src/sources.json`). Both are
  in `Cargo.toml`'s `exclude` so the published `.crate` tarball builds without
  their sibling files; a submodule of a grouped binary can't be individually
  excluded (the parent's `mod` would fail to compile on the extracted crate).
- **A multi-file binary is `tests/<area>/main.rs`, NOT `tests/<area>.rs`.** A
  top-level `area.rs` is a *crate root* — its `mod foo;` resolves to `tests/foo.rs`
  (a sibling), not `tests/area/foo.rs`. The `<area>/main.rs` dir form makes `mod`
  resolve inside `<area>/`. (nextest still runs every `#[test]` in its own process,
  so fewer binaries = faster linking, same parallelism.)
- **`conformance.rs` (the harness) asserts every dir under `sources/fixtures/` is a
  registered source** (`descriptor_for(dirname).is_some()`) and that each scenario
  dir holds exactly one transcript/hook file → one AgentId. So single-owner,
  multi-payload fixtures (decode's hooks/jsonl, codex's lifecycle file) CANNOT live
  there — they'd be mis-scanned and panic. They co-locate with their module instead.
- **insta snapshot names = `<binary>__<module>__<explicit-name>`** → `sources__conformance__<source>__<scenario>.snap`. The decoded-event bodies hash an `AgentId` from the fixture's path *relative to `fixtures_root()`* — so moving the fixtures tree is snapshot-safe as long as the per-source suffix is preserved.
