//! Per-furniture approach geometry: where does an agent stand when it
//! visits a waypoint?
//!
//! The waypoint's `pos` is the furniture's geometric CENTER, which for
//! obstacle furniture (pantry counter, vending machine, …) is a blocked
//! cell — an agent can't stand on it. [`stand_point`] resolves the actual
//! stand cell: the walkable cell just off the footprint, on the side
//! nearest the agent's home desk. Walls naturally constrain it (a machine
//! flush against a wall only exposes its open side), so a counter is
//! approachable from any open side ("360°") while a recessed appliance is
//! approached from the front — matching the real world.
//!
//! Pure geometry over [`WalkableMask`] — no A*, no terminal deps — so the
//! stateless `core::pose::idle_pose` and the stateful `tui::motion` walk
//! destinations stay in lockstep with the render anchor (all three call
//! this with the same `origin = home desk`).
