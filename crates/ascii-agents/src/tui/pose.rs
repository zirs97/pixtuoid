//! TUI-side pose layer.
//!
//! Re-exports the pure pose-derivation surface from `ascii_agents_core::pose`
//! and adds the binary-side machinery:
//!   * `PoseHistory` — per-agent cache of the last rendered position.
//!   * `derive_with_routing` — the routed variant of `derive` that consults
//!     a `&mut dyn Router` so walking poses follow A*-routed polylines and
//!     so state transitions are smoothed with a snap-back walk instead of
//!     teleporting back to the desk.
//!
//! Keeping the routed code on this side means `ascii-agents-core` does not
//! depend on the pathfinder — the trait lives in the binary because A* is
//! TUI-rendering-adjacent and may differ for non-terminal renderers.
