//! State → pose derivation for the coworking-lounge renderer.
//!
//! Pure function: given an `AgentSlot`, current `SystemTime`, and `Layout`,
//! returns which `Pose` the agent should appear in this frame. Includes the
//! wander state machine for Idle agents (cycles between desk and waypoints).
//!
//! Variation knobs:
//!  * `cycle_ms_for(agent_id)` — per-agent wander cycle length so the office
//!    stops feeling clockwork-synchronized. Range 7..13s.
//!  * Waypoint choice XORs `agent_id` with the current cycle number, so each
//!    cycle the same agent picks a (likely) different waypoint.
