//! Zone-based scene layout for the top-down office — primitive geometry
//! only, no terminal deps. Computed once per (buf_w, buf_h, num_agents)
//! triple; serializable / wire-shippable for the future v2 daemon split.
//!
//! Splits a buf-pixel rectangle into quadrants (meeting / pantry /
//! cubicles / lounge), then computes per-agent home desks, named lounge
//! waypoints, decor positions, and a per-pixel walkability mask.
//!
//! Submodules:
//!   * `decor` — the four furniture/decor enums (vocabulary).
//!   * `mask`  — `build_walkable_mask`: stamps obstacles for routing.
