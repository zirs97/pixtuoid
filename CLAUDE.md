# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code (or any AI coding agent) working in this repo.

## What this is

Terminal-native, multi-agent pixel-art visualizer for AI coding agents. Each running CC (Claude Code) session shows up as an animated half-block sprite in an ASCII office. Built in Rust as a Cargo workspace of three crates.

User-facing overview: [`README.md`](README.md).
v1 spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-20-ascii-agents-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-20-ascii-agents-design.md).
v1 plan (28 TDD-shaped tasks): [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-20-ascii-agents-v1.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-20-ascii-agents-v1.md).

## Build & test

```
cargo build --workspace                                              # debug build
cargo build --release --workspace                                    # release build
cargo test --workspace --features ascii-agents-core/test-renderer    # all tests (64+)
cargo run --release --example snapshot -- /tmp/snap.png              # render TUI to PNG
./target/release/ascii-agents run --headless --projects-root ~/.claude/projects   # live test against real CC
```

The `test-renderer` feature is needed for the `e2e.rs` integration test. The dev workspace test alias is just `cargo test`.

## Conventions

- **TDD first.** Plan and existing tests are TDD-shaped — failing test → minimal impl → commit. Don't add code without a test that exercises it.
- **DRY, YAGNI.** No features beyond what v1 specifies. v2 items are deferred — adding them in v1 code is a regression.
- **No comments unless WHY.** Don't write comments that restate what the code does. Comment only when a future reader can't tell from the code why something is the way it is (a workaround, a non-obvious constraint, a surprising invariant).
- **Errors propagate via `anyhow::Result` in app code, `thiserror` in core if a typed error becomes load-bearing.** The hook listener and JSONL watcher log + continue on malformed input — they never panic.
- **No `unwrap()` in non-test code.** Tests can unwrap freely.
- **Match the surrounding shell:** scripts in this repo target zsh (interactive) or POSIX sh. `shellcheck` any `.sh` you touch.
- **macOS first.** BSD-flavored CLI, brew, launchd for daemons. The hook shim is Unix-socket specific (`std::os::unix::net::UnixStream`).

## Architecture invariants

These are load-bearing; don't break them without updating the spec.

1. **`ascii-agents-core` has no terminal dependencies.** No `ratatui`, no `crossterm`, no `stdout` writes. If you need one, the abstraction belongs behind the `Renderer` trait.
2. **Events flow through ONE channel** typed `mpsc::Sender<(Transport, AgentEvent)>`. The `Transport` tag is load-bearing — the reducer uses it for hook-wins dedup. Do not hardcode `Transport::Hook` on the consumer side; the producer (each Source impl) tags its own events.
3. **`Source` trait is the only seam for adding agent CLIs** (Codex / Cursor / Gemini / Copilot). Don't bypass it.
4. **`install-hooks` writes through symlinks.** `resolve_symlink` in `install/io.rs` is critical for stow-managed `~/.claude/settings.json`. Don't replace it with `fs::rename` on the symlink path.
5. **The hook shim must never block CC.** Always exit 0 silently on any error. The 200ms write timeout is non-negotiable.

## Known sharp edges (don't be surprised by these)

- **CC hook payloads DO include `tool_use_id`** in `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` (verified by sniffing live payloads). The decoder reads it; the reducer's hook-wins dedup actually fires.
- **CC hook `transcript_path` always points to the PARENT'S transcript**, even when a subagent is the actor — so subagent hook events hash to the parent's `AgentId`. The reducer's `active_tasks: HashMap<AgentId, HashSet<String>>` suppresses hook `ActivityStart`/`End` for any agent currently inside a `Task` tool; JSONL has correct subagent attribution via the per-subagent transcript file at `<parent_uuid>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`. The Task signal travels as `ToolDetail::Task` (a typed enum variant on `AgentEvent::ActivityStart.detail`, set by `decoder::make_tool_detail` whenever `tool_name == "Task"`); the reducer pattern-matches on `d.is_task()` rather than scanning a free-form string.
- **JSONL watcher skips historical transcripts on startup.** `initial_seed_root` in `source/jsonl.rs` only emits `SessionStart` for `.jsonl` files with mtime within `DEFAULT_INITIAL_WINDOW` (currently 1 hour; configurable via `JsonlWatcher::with_initial_window`); older files have their cursor seeded at end-of-file. Without this, ~hundreds of stale sessions saturate the desk allocator (default `--max-desks=16`). Long-idle live sessions only re-appear after they next write. The window was bumped from 10 min after users hit "I had a CC session open but it had been idle a while; nothing showed up until I made a new tool call."
- **Subagent display names come from `attributionAgent` in JSONL.** The decoder strips the plugin prefix (`feature-dev:code-explorer` → `code-explorer`) and emits `AgentEvent::Rename` so labels read meaningfully. Parents get their `cwd` basename instead.
- **`AgentSlot.state_started_at` is `std::time::SystemTime`** — process-local in practice (no wall-clock anchoring), but the type is already serializable, so the v2 daemon split won't need a type swap. The pose system computes elapsed time relative to it for animation timing.
- **`draw_scene` is a free function on the binary side**, not a `Renderer` impl. The trait exists in `core`, but the production runtime calls `draw_scene` directly. Wire through the trait when the daemon split lands.
- **`recolor_frame` substitutes by RGB equality.** Works because each palette key in the default pack maps to a unique RGB. If you add a sprite pack where two keys share a color, swap to a palette-key-indexed approach instead.
- **Terminal cell aspect drives sprite design.** The half-block ▀ technique assumes ~1:2 cell aspect. Sprites larger than ~16×16 px break on terminals with taller cells (Ghostty default, large Fira Code). The bundled 12×14 pack is the safe ceiling. A PNG-loader experiment hit this wall and was deleted in favor of hand-drawn `.sprite` art.

## Things NOT to do

- Don't add `ratatui` / `crossterm` / terminal anything to `ascii-agents-core`.
- Don't write to `~/.claude/settings.json` directly. Always go through `install/io.rs::write_settings_atomic` (advisory lock + atomic rename + symlink resolution).
- Don't add `println!` / `eprintln!` to any production path other than the headless summary and explicit user-facing CLI output. Use `tracing::{info, warn, error}` instead.
- Don't relax the hook shim's "always exit 0" contract. Blocking CC = breaking the user's primary workflow.
- Don't add `--no-verify` / hook-skipping flags to any git operations performed in this repo.
- Don't generate a README / CLAUDE.md / CHANGELOG / docs in PRs unless explicitly asked.
- Don't `git push` without explicit user confirmation, even after committing.

## Where to look

- "How does a CC tool call become a moving sprite?" → trace `runtime::run_async` → `ClaudeCodeSource::run` → `HookSocketListener::run` → `decoder::decode_hook_payload` → `reducer::Reducer::apply` → `tui::renderer::draw_scene` (top-down, cubicle grid).
- "How is the office laid out?" → `core::layout::SceneLayout::compute` for zone math (cubicle band / walkway / lounge band) + home-desk + waypoint placement (re-exported as `tui::layout::Layout`); `tui::pose::derive` for state→pose mapping including the Idle wander state machine (`WANDER_CYCLE_BASE_MS=7000` + per-agent jitter); `tui::renderer::draw_scene` for pixel painting + half-block flush. Decor helpers: `paint_floor_and_walls`, `paint_rug`, `paint_lounge_decor` (couch + coffee + plants).
- "Why is the subagent's sprite the right one and not the parent?" → `reducer::Reducer::apply` does subagent-leak suppression via `active_tasks` before applying. `decoder::decode_jsonl_line` emits `AgentEvent::Rename` from `attributionAgent`.
- "Why don't old idle sessions show on startup?" → `source::jsonl::initial_seed_root`. mtime > `DEFAULT_INITIAL_WINDOW` (10 min) → cursor seeded at EOF, no `SessionStart`.
- "How does the default character pack get into the binary?" → `tui::embedded_pack` does the `include_str!` at compile time; `sprite::format::load_pack_from_strings` parses it.
- "How do hooks get installed?" → `install::merge::merge_install` for the JSON merge logic, `install::io::write_settings_atomic` for the safe filesystem write.

## When refactoring

If you change anything in the channel type, `Source` trait, `AgentEvent` enum, or reducer signature, update **all four** test files that exercise them: `tests/reducer.rs`, `tests/e2e.rs`, `tests/hook_socket.rs`, `tests/jsonl_watcher.rs`, plus `runtime.rs` on the binary side. The `AgentEvent::agent_id()` method in `source/mod.rs` needs a new arm too if you add a variant.
